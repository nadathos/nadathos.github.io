I have been working on an electronic music album for about a year now. Originally I wanted to create music
for a video game we're developing with V-NA on their Veganeko project in our free time

<!-- put this at the end of what we wish to have as an excerpt -->
([Check out their instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/veganekoweirdo/)).
Composing this music was so much fun that I decided to make a short EP out of it.

It is a very personal project and some of the music I used has been on my mind for over 5 years. The whole tone of it is
that of an ironic observer living all over Europe during quite turbulent times and at the same time an homage to the people
who taught me to appreciate and make music and to those I am now spending most of my time with. As with everything I do,
I want to express the point of view of somebody who was profoundly influenced by old traditions but is constantly looking
for an adequate description of contemporary existence.
In musical terms, I try to reconcile classical structure and development with electronic sounds, my idols from the past with my hopes for the future.
