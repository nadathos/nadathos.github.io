## What|s "Cow Working Space" all about?

By the end of 2020 a couple of things happened that decided the concept of this album. Covid was coming back, Cyberpunk2077 released,
NFT|s became a huge deal and my partner and main vocalist VeganekoWeirdo got so fed up with Zoom meetings that she suggested a musical collaboration
where we|d talk about how we perceive life somewhere in our 30s.

I had been looking for an authentic artistic expression for the last 10 years or so. In music, I wanted to make emotional, rich tracks
but reference contemporary culture, technology, hopes, dreams and fears about the future. I thought that somehow the world had not grasped
recent developments on an intuitiv level yet and it would be the artist|s role to provide some pointers.
What I saw now is that in reality the opposite is true. People seem to have very strong feelings about today|s life and the near future,
almost all of them negative: cynicism, panic, fear of obsolescence, fear of living in an IoT meatgrinder, where we eventually perish without
ever finding meaning or purpose. While reading "Homo Deus" by Yuval Harari I realized that even outside of purely technophile circles people
were seriously starting to consider the possiblity that most of our lives won|t have any social meanaing whatsover. When Cyberpunk released,
I found myself absorbed in its cynical and downright violent world. I am an optimist and like to dream about the
possibilities humanity is about to unlock for itself. I like to understand some of the science behind it. But I had to admit, the world today
resembles Cyberpunk more than the brothers Strugatsky. It feels like a clownshow where you can become a millionaire overnight by posting bad
jokes on the right subreddit and never accomplish anything by farsighted work.

Cow Working Space is about this feeling, this atmosphere. It|s our _The Last Day of Pompeii_ or _Dr.Strangelove_ .

## Stylistic Remarks and personal development

We wanted to make this record as personal as possible. Only our vocals, our texts, mix, artwork.
Most hyperpolished, megaproduced, overhyped stuff out there smells like fake all the way to Mt. Olympus. I feel like low fidelity and eccentricity
outweigh commercial productions, it|s a feature, not a bug. In a day where social relationships are guided by discovery algorithms
designed to drive advertisement and not personal growth, not pretending to be anything but oneself just feels good.

It was the first time that I worked with vocals and also used my own voice as an instrument and for a couple of sung lines. For me personally this is a big
achievement and it won|t be the last time! Stylistically I continue to draw inspiration from classical music and video games but this time I went for
some more agressive textures at times and the distant past of electronic music, where tunes where more optimistic.

This year VeganekoWeirdo and I are celebrating our 10 year anniversary and "Cow Working Space" is a wonderful memorial to our life together. I am very happy
with how it turned out and now on to new projects!

The album will be available on bandcamp June 1st: [Bandcamp](https://riesenradler.bandcamp.com/album/cow-working-space)
