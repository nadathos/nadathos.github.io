New album: Under The Nanorain

Imagine living above the clouds in a city grown story upon story into the future.
The lower parts still have the layout of an old european town, historistic facades, gothic cathedral, the odd sturdy merchant house from the middle ages but reinforced with polymer and metal, as their primary role is to serve as foundation for the new life above. Elegant skyscrapers grow thousands of meters into the air, the highest of them disappearing far into the clouds and beyond.
Up there islands of beautiful pillars can be seen in every direction, airborne traffic commuting between them. A man has to chose between a quiet, happy life with his family and a life full of sacrifices to contribute something great in an era, where technological wonders happen all the time, The Nanorain.

    Musical style: experimental electronic with touches of piano, digital synths and voices.

I have been working on an electronic music album for about a year now. Originally I wanted to create music
for a video game we're developing with V-NA on their Veganeko project in our free time

([Check out their instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/veganekoweirdo/)).
Composing this music was so much fun that I decided to make a short EP out of it.

It is a very personal project and some of the music I used has been on my mind for over 5 years. The whole tone of it is
that of an ironic observer living all over Europe during quite turbulent times and at the same time an homage to the people
who taught me to appreciate and make music and to those I am now spending most of my time with. As with everything I do,
I want to express the point of view of somebody who was profoundly influenced by old traditions but is constantly looking
for an adequate description of contemporary existence.
In musical terms, I try to reconcile classical structure and development with electronic sounds, my idols from the past with my hopes for the future.
