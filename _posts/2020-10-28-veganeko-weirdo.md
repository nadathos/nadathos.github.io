Together with @VeganekoWeirdo, we made a small video game about a cat that always falls on its feet.
<!--more-->
<!-- put this at the end of what we wish to have as an excerpt -->
It was an amazing experience! We used Unreal Engine 4 and learned basically everything from scratch. I would
definitely like to do this again some time and my respect for people in game development, especially indie
games, has only grown. It is difficult to imagine how much work goes into these works we take for granted,
without having done it at least once.

In the game cats fall in random positions from the top of the screen. You have to turn them around so that they
land on their feet at the bottom. The cat will face left or right and you can only turn in that direction.
When you win, a new cat spawns, falling slightly faster.
You have 9 tries, because where we come from, cats have 9 lives...
The four difficulties determine the initial falling speed and the increase when you win.
There is no time limit, get the highest score possible and unlock all the rewards and collectible cards!

You can find the game for free on [itch.io](https://riesenradler.itch.io/veganeko-weirdo) . It works perfectly fine on
Windows 7 upwards.
