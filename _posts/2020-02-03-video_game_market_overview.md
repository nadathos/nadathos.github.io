TODO:
* who constitutes the market,
* how did they perform
* compared to a couple of other markets

* which subgroups do we have, mobile, free to play, pc, console, indie...
    countries...
* for the subset that interests me, what where their milestones in 2019, whats their outlook, maybe whats their valuation and why

* classify the top given some fundamental metrics, stock growth, revenue growth...

* build an index, calculate beta, volatility, biggest movers

* try to get sales numbers and estimate market size

* think about a couple of regressions against commodities, interest rates, exchange rates, maybe scores on metacritic or posts on reddit and twitter if available.

* think about a MC simulation with these regression parameters.
