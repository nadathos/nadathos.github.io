My name is Oliver, I'm a composer, programmer, writer and designer currently residing in France.
With this blog I want to approach these goals:


First I want to use it to motivate myself to finish projects. At the moment I'm finishing an electronic music album as well as game prototypes in unreal engine and smaller python programs. Once they are marginally presentable I'm going to post them here. If any of these pique your interest, you want to use them for your own work or you want to collab you can contact me anytime!


I'm also heavily interested in both traditional fine art and video games and have always wondered, why the astounding artistic work done for games gains so little attention. I want to write about the talent in video games, promote individuals and generally bring these two worlds closer together


I find the video games industry fascinating also from a business standpoint. So expect a couple of articles about the businesses in the industry, their valuation and their management.

If you have any suggestions, questions or you want to chat over at discord, you can send me an email to: <oliver.idim@gmail.com>
