Riesenradler is an Austrian musician and video game developer.
Born in Vienna, classical music has been a huge influence early on but it was the discovery of the possibilities of electronic music, that led to his own style between classical composition and futuristic synthesized soundscapes.
He has been living an international life since moving to France a couple of years back, heavily interested in languages, science and technology. which also represent the recurring themes of his music: the idea of a world without cultural barriers and our place in a rapidly changing but exciting present and future.

Riesenradler released his debut album "Dimsum & Jetlag" in April 2020 and is currently looking to publish his second "Under The Nanorain" on November 1st 2020.
