Riesenradler is a composer, programmer, writer and designer currently residing in France.
With this blog I want to approach these goals:

This blog should become a collection of personal thoughts, a kind of research journal for content, that cannot be adequately represented on your typical social media site.

In addition to presenting the background to personal projects, I'm also heavily interested in both traditional fine art and digital art / video games and have always wondered,
why the astounding artistic work done in purely virtual form gains so little attention. I want to write about the most modern art forms and generally bring these two worlds closer together.

If you have any suggestions, questions or you want to chat over at discord, you can send me an email to: <riesenradler@gmail.com>


Colophon: this site is hosted on GitHub via Github Pages, it is written with Jekyll. All other content is my own unless otherwise specified.
